# noce
Nahuatl Orthography Conversion Engine

This code, which has existed in my Nahuatl Tools
project in various forms and iterations, is now
being broken out into its own project in order
to refine and standardize the engine.

Low-level stuff is in nahuatl_tools.js

Metaword processing is in noce.js

Finally, ncv.js allows you to use the noce engine
as a command-line tool.
